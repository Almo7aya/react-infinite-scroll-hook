Will release soon :)

This is a hook to create infinite scroll components!  
It has a really basic logic that solved a lot of problems for me. So, I just wanted to publish it as a package.

Basically;  
`useInfiniteScroll` hook checks the DOM with an interval and looks at the distance between the bottom of your "infinite" component and the bottom of the window.  
You can set `scrollContainer` prop to `parent` if you want to use the scrollable parent of that infinite container and not the window.
