Will release soon :)

This is a hook to create infinite scroll components!  
It has a really basic logic that solved a lot of problems for me. So, I just wanted to publish it as a package.

Basically;  
`useInfiniteScroll` hook checks the DOM with an interval and looks at the distance between the bottom of your "infinite" component and the bottom of the window.  
You can set `scrollContainer` prop to `parent` if you want to use the scrollable parent of that infinite container and not the window.  

While setting the interval, we use another custom hook named `useInterval` and make the `setInterval` declarative. It has been explained by Dan Abramov [here](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/).
